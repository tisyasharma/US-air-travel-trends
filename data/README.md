# Data folder

Expected contents for rebuilding the site data (inputs only):
- `raw_data/` - source T-100 CSVs (not tracked)
- `clean_data/` - cleaned flight CSVs (not tracked)
- `airports.csv` - airport lookup (IATA, name, city, state, country, latitude, longitude)

Web app data outputs live in `public/data/`:
- `flow_links.json`, `carriers_by_origin.json`, `monthly_metrics.json`, `carrier_market_share.json` (generated by `scripts/build_web_data.py`)
- `linked_scatter_histogram.json` (Altair spec generated in `notebooks/02_analysis.ipynb`)

Note: `airports.csv` is required for rebuilds but is not included in the repo. Place it here before running the build script.
